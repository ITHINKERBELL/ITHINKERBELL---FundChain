# FundChain

In a world increasingly driven by connectivity and collaboration, FundChain emerges as a pioneering platform at the intersection of blockchain technology and crowdfunding. With the ethos of decentralization and transparency at its core, we can imagine the landscape of charitable giving and fundraising, harnessing the transformative potential of Web3.

Introducing FundChain, the worldâ€™s first Web3 crowdfunding application.
Here is an image of our architecture diagram to show you how everything works:

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with our project, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)


## Prerequisites


  1. Install WSL or wsl.exe --install in command prompt with Administrative Rights
     The link is here just in case you want a detailed guide on how to do it: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

  2. Install NVM in the wsl terminal:
    - curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
    - nvm install node
    - node --version
  3. Install DFX or sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)" in the wsl terminal. 
    - sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
    - sudo apt install pkg-config
    - sudo apt install libssl-dev
    - sudo apt-get update


## Running the project locally

If you want to test our app locally, you can use the following commands (make sure you're using the wsl terminal with this):

```bash
git clone <the link of our github repo>
cd <name of the folder>
npm i 
dfx start
dfx deploy project_backend (do this in another terminal since dfx start needs to run)
dfx generate 
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

## If you want to make changes with our application please follow the guide below:
If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
